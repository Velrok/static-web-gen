The move to switch the blog to a custom static web page generator was great.
However in that process I lost the comments feature. I realised that this is a mayor issues, because I'm loosing out on potential feedback.
Sure comments may come with moderation issues, but I doubt that this is going to be a real concern, given the small amount of traffic.


## What to use for comments then?

I recently came across [utterances](https://utteranc.es) which uses GitHub issues as its back-end to store comments.

I see a few really cool features:

 1. All my posts are usually technical in nature so requiring people to log in via GitHub to leave a comment shouldn't be a major barrier.
 2. Since every comment will create an GitHub issue, I can leverage their notification system to see and respond to the feedback people leave.


So please leave a comment or just a :thumbs_up: :).
