Over the last few months I've started to modernize many of the typical command
line interface (cli) tools I use. In some cases I replaced graphical user
interface (GUI) apps with simple interactive cli tools.

Here is my list of modern cli tools.
In addition I found more comprehensive lists from
[Jakub](https://zaiste.net/posts/shell-commands-rust/)
and [Sebastian Witowski](https://switowski.com/blog/favorite-cli-tools).
