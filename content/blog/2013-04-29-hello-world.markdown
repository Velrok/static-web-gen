Hello world, again.


This is about the 4th blog I started.

This time it should be around for longer, beacaue [octopress](http://octopress.org/) is nicer than wordpress - from a programmers standpoint :) .
Also since it's hosted on [github](www.github.com) - I will not losse it.

``` clojure clojure
(defn hello [name]
  (println "hello, " name))

(hello "world")
```

``` python python
def hello(name):
  print "hello, ", name

hello("world")
```

``` ruby ruby
def hello(name)
  puts "hello, #{name}"
end

hello "world"
```
